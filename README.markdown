###Description

A simple sample flashlight app created in Mono for Android.

###Background

My new Samsung Galaxy Nexus didn't come with a flashlight app like the HTC Incredible [1] that it replaced. With an inherent distrust of free Android apps, I decided to make my own. Many Java tutorials and development quirks later (first versiion worked great on Android 2.2 but failed miserably on Android 4.0), and I had the start of a useful app.

###Coming Soon

1. Toggle image for on/off state.
1. Try to prevent "blinking" when rotating the device.
1. Show white screen as pseudo-flashlight for devices without a camera flash.
1. Try to figure out a way to use the flash even when the device doesn't support torch mode.
